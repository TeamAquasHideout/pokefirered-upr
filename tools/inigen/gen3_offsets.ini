TMTextSpdc[]=[26,0x169F68,TM26 contains [move].\pIt is a powerful technique.\pI made it when I ran the GYM here, far too long ago…]
TMTextSpdc[]=[27,0x16FEDA,TM27 is a move called [move]…\pIf you treat your POKéMON good, it will return your love by working its hardest in battle.]
TMTextSpdc[]=[28,0x16A983,Those miserable ROCKETS!\pLook what they’ve done to my house!\pThey stole a TM for teaching POKéMON how to [move]!\pThat cost me a bundle, it did!]
TMTextSpdc[]=[28,0x16A98D,I figure what’s lost is lost.\pI decided to catch a POKéMON that could [move] without a TM.]

TMTextSpdc[]=[39,0x16A62C,A TM, Technical Machine, contains a technique for POKéMON.\pUsing a TM teaches the move it contains to a POKéMON.\pA TM is good for only one use.\pSo, when you use one, pick the POKéMON carefully.\pAnyways… TM39 contains [move].]

MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[0,0x1C49A4,You’ll be back when you understand the worth of [move].]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[1,0x1C4B63,Not many people come out here.\pIf I train here, I’m convinced that I’ll get stronger and stronger.\pYep, stronger and stronger…\pHow would you like to learn a strong move? It’s [move].]

MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[3,0x1C4D91,Ready? Boing!\pWe’re having a wrestling match to see who wimps out first.\pIf you were to join us, you’d be squashed like a bug, though…\pHow about I teach [move] to a POKéMON of yours instead?]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[3,0x1C4DB4,Which POKéMON wants to learn how to [move]?]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[4,0x1C47BB,You should be proud of yourself, having battled your way through VICTORY ROAD so courageously.\pIn recognition of your feat, I’ll teach you [move].\pWould you like me to teach that technique?]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[4,0x1C47DE,Which POKéMON should I teach [move]?]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[5,0x1C4C33,Oh, hi! I finally finished POKéMON.\pNot done yet? How about I teach you a good move?\pThe move I have in mind is [move].]

MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[5,0x1C4C86,Are you using that [move] move I taught your POKéMON?]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[6,0x1C4BCB,The secrets of space… The mysteries of earth…\pThere are so many things about which we know so little.\pBut that should spur us to study harder, not toss in the towel.\pThe only thing you should toss…\pWell, how about [move]? Should I teach that to a POKéMON?]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[6,0x1C4BEE,Which POKéMON wants to learn [move]?]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[7,0x1C4D01,Oh wow! A POKé DOLL!\pFor me? Thank you!\pYou know what? I can teach the move [move].]

MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[8,0x1C4C9B,Tch-tch-tch! I’ll teach you a nifty move.\pTeach it to a POKéMON, and watch the fun unfold!\pIt’s a move called [move]. Does it strike your fancy?]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[8,0x1C4CEE,Tch-tch-tch! That’s the sound of a metronome.\pIt inspired me to start teaching [move] to interested trainers.]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[9,0x1C4A93,Hello, there!\pI’ve seen you about, but I never had a chance to chat.\pIt must be good luck that brought us together finally.\pI’d like to celebrate by teaching you the move [move].]

MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[10,0x1C4A2B,Yawn! I must have dozed off in the sun.\pI had this weird dream about a DROWZEE eating my dream.\pAnd… I learned how to teach [move]…\pOogh, this is too spooky!\pLet me teach it to a POKéMON so I can forget about it!]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[10,0x1C4A4E,Which POKéMON wants to learn [move]?]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[11,0x1C4823,Eeek! No! Stop! Help!\pOh, you’re not with TEAM ROCKET. I’m sorry, I thought…\pWill you forgive me if I teach you the [move] technique?]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[11,0x1C4846,Which POKéMON should I teach [move]?]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[11,0x1C4876,[move] is a useful move, but it might not work on some POKéMON.]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[11,0x1C486C,Oh… But [move] is convenient…]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[12,0x1C48F3,Can you imagine? If this volcano were to erupt?\pThe explosion would be the end of us. How terrifying is that?\pWhile we’re terrified, would you like me to teach [move]?]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[12,0x1C4916,You’re terribly brave!\pWhich POKéMON should I teach [move]?]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[12,0x1C4946,Using [move] while on this volcano…\pWhat a terrifying thrill!]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[13,0x1C488B,When you’re up on a rocky mountain like this, rockslides are a threat.\pCan you imagine? Boulders tumbling down on you?\pThat’d be, like, waaaaaaaaaaah! Total terror!\pYou don’t seem to be scared. Want to try using [move]?]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[13,0x1C48AE,Which POKéMON should I teach [move]?]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[14,0x1C4AFB,Aww, I wish I was a KANGASKHAN baby.\pI’d love to be a substitute for the baby…\pAnd snuggle in the mother KANGASKHAN’s belly pouch.\pBut only POKéMON can do that…\pOn an unrelated note, want me to teach [move] to one of your POKéMON?]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[14,0x1C4B1E,Which POKéMON wants to learn [move]?]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[14,0x1C4B44,Oh, really? [move] seems so fun…]
